The My Account page contains four main tabs for configuring your account:

* <<Profile>>
* <<Groups>>
* <<Password>>
* <<Preferences>>

==== Profile
The Profile tab contains a form for viewing and editing your basic profile information. This information includes your [underline]#First Name#, [underline]#Last Name#, and [underline]#Email# address. None of this information is required. Your current settings for these fields will be displayed to start. To edit, simply change the values in one or more of the fields and and click btn:[Save] in the bottom right. If the change was successful, you will see a success message at the top of the section.
