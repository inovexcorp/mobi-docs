<p>The initial view of the Ontology Editor shows the Ontologies page. The center of the page contains a paginated list of all ontologies in the local Mobi repository. Each ontology in the list displays ontology metadata and an action menu. The action menu allows you to delete the ontology. Deleting an ontology from this location will delete the ontology and associated ontology record and change history from the local catalog. Clicking an ontology will open it in the editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When opening an ontology, the editor will load the previous branch and commit you were viewing. If you have not previously opened the ontology or the branch you were viewing no longer exists, then the editor will load the HEAD commit of the ontology&#8217;s master branch. For an explanation of commits and branches see the section on

<h4 id="_creating_new_ontologies">Creating New Ontologies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new ontology, select the btn:[New Ontology] button on the main ontology editor view. In the creation dialog, you are required to provide an ontology IRI and title. You can also optionally provide a description and keywords. This metadata is used to describe the ontology in the local catalog.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <span class="underline">Ontology IRI</span> is the unique identifier for the new ontology. The editor pre-populates this field with a default namespace and a local name generated from the <span class="underline">Title</span> field. You can always override this behavior. The <span class="underline">Title</span> field populates the <code>dcterms:title</code> annotations of both the new ontology record and the ontology object within the new ontology. The <span class="underline">Description</span> field populates the <code>dcterms:description</code> annotations of both the new ontology record and the ontology object within the new ontology. The <span class="underline">Keywords</span> field will attach the entered values as keywords to the new ontology record.</p>

<h4 id="_uploading_existing_ontologies">Uploading Existing Ontologies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To upload an existing ontology, you can either click the btn:[Upload Ontology] button and use the browser&#8217;s native file browser or drag and drop files onto the main ontologies view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When uploading a file or files, a dialog box will prompt you for metadata entry for the ontology record (title, description, keywords). This metadata is used to describe the ontology in the local catalog. By default, the application will set the record title using the filename. Metadata for each ontology can be entered and submitted separately, or default metadata can be entered for all records using the btn:[Submit All] button.</p>

The <span class="underline">Description</span> field populates the <code>dcterms:description</code> annotation of the new ontology record. The <span class="underline">Keywords</span> field will attach the entered values as keywords to the new ontology record.

<h4 id="_ontology_versioning">Ontology Versioning</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each ontology in Mobi is versioned in a manner similar to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> Version Control System, whereby all changes to an ontology are collected into a chain "commits" which form a commit history called a "branch". Thus, every version in the history of an ontology can be generated by selecting a commit and applying all the changes in the branch back to the initial commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every ontology is initialized with a MASTER branch that contains the initial commit. Work can be done on this MASTER branch or can be split out into separate branches. Work done on these branches occur in isolation until they are merged back into the MASTER branch, joining any other changes committed in the meantime. When merging two branches, the ontology editor does its best to combine any changes made on both branches. If a conflict occurs, the editor allows the user to resolve them manually. More information on merging branches can be found in the section on <a href="#_merging_branches">Merging Branches</a>.</p>

<h5 id="_checking_out_branchestagscommits">Checking Out Branches/Tags/Commits</h5>

<p>The check out select box located underneath the selected ontology in the left display, provides a list of all the available branches and tags on the ontology. To checkout a branch or tag, simply select the branch in the drop-down menu. Checking out a tag will open the ontology at the tagged commit in read-only mode. If you have checked out a commit from the <a href="#_commits_tab">Commits Tab</a>, the commit will be in the dropdown list and show as selected. Note that the select box will be disabled if you have any uncommitted changes on the current branch. To edit a branch name or description, click on the edit icon next to the branch in the drop-down menu. You cannot edit the master branch of an ontology.</p>

Saving changes without committing allows a user to edit an ontology through a number of browser sessions before making any commits to the commit history. These changes are unique to the user, and are available to other users once a commit is performed.  They are grouped by individual entity and display the triples on the entity grouped by property.  When a “Show Full” toggle is active, the changes display is updated to include all the other triples on that changed entity.</p>

<p>The Edit IRI overlay provides the user with a simple way to edit and create valid IRIs. The <span class="underline">Begins with</span> field (required) is the beginning of the IRI. This is more commonly known as the namespace. When editing the IRI of entities within an ontology, this value is typically the ontology IRI. The <span class="underline">Then</span> field (required) is the next character in the IRI. This value can be thought of the separator between the namespace and local name (described below). The provided values for the <span class="underline">Then</span> field are "&#35;", "/", and ":". The <span class="underline">Ends with</span> field (required) is the last part of the IRI. This value is commonly known as the local name. It is used in the drop down lists in this application as the easiest way to identify what the IRI references. Clicking the refresh button on the left will reset the three fields to their original values. You cannot create/save an edited IRI that already exists within the ontology. Clicking btn:[Cancel] will close the overlay. Clicking btn:[Submit] will save the IRI with the entered values for the selected entity and update the ontology.</p>

The title section includes a bold title and the property IRI. The values section lists all the values set for the displayed property along with the type, if the value is a literal, and edit and delete buttons when you hover over the value. The functionality of the edit and delete buttons for values differ depending on where the Property Value Display is being used. If a value of a property is a class restriction or expression, it will be represented in a simplified format or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-manchester-syntax/">Manchester Syntax</a> if it is supported.
