The <<configuration-guide,Configuration>> for the Mobi software itself is set in configuration files. The <<mobi-shell-guide,Mobi Shell>> also provides several commands for accessing the application data. The home page of Mobi includes some quick action buttons for performing common tasks and a display of the latest key activities performed by users throughout the application. Each activity displays a summary about the action performed, who did it, and when it happened. The list is sorted with the latest activities first and is paginated so you can view earlier actions.
