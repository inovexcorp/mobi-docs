=== Datasets Manager
The Mobi Datasets Manager allows users to create, edit, clear, and delete datasets within the application to group and store Resource Description Framework (https://www.w3.org/RDF/[RDF]) semantic data into various graphs for enhanced query isolation, data segmentation, and management.

TIP: To learn more about the structure of a dataset, refer to the <<Mobi Datasets>> Appendix.

To reach the Datasets Manager, click on the link in the left menu.

The page displays a searchable paginated list of all the datasets within the local Mobi repository. Each dataset in the list displays a preview of the dataset metadata and a dropdown menu with upload data, edit, clear, and delete buttons. Deleting a dataset deletes the dataset, catalog record, and all associated data graphs. Clearing a dataset removes all associated data graphs except the system default named graph. Clearing a dataset does not remove the dataset or the catalog record. Editing a dataset allows to you to change some information about the dataset. The btn:[Upload Data] button allows you to upload graph data to the dataset from a file. 

To create a new dataset, click btn:[New Dataset] and fill out the information in the creation overlay.

==== Create Dataset

The Create New Dataset overlay contains several sections. The [underline]#Title# field populates the `dcterms:title` annotation of the new dataset record. The [underline]#Dataset IRI# field allows you to specify what the IRI of the new dataset should be. If not provided, the system will create a unique one for you. The [underline]#Description# field populates the `dcterms:description` annotation of the new dataset record. The [underline]#Keywords# field will attach the entered values as keywords to the new dataset record. The [underline]#Repository ID# field displays the identifier of the repository registered within Mobi where the dataset and all associated named graphs will be stored. For now, this is defaulted to the system repository. Finally, you can select which ontologies should be used as the basis for the data. Select an ontology from the searchable list of ontologies to add it to the dataset. To remove a selected ontology, click the x next to the ontology name. Clicking btn:[Cancel] will close the overlay. Clicking btn:[Submit] will create the dataset with the provided metadata.

NOTE: The ability to create new repositories in Mobi is coming soon!

==== Edit Dataset
.Edit Dataset Overlay

The Edit Dataset overlay allows you to modify information about the dataset. The [underline]#Title# field modifies the value of the `dcterms:title` annotation of the dataset record. The [underline]#Description# field modifies the value of the `dcterms:description` annotation of the dataset record. The [underline]#Keywords# field allows you to add/remove keywords attached to the dataset record. The ontologies area allows you to modify the ontologies associated with the dataset record; just as during creation. Clicking btn:[Update] will update the dataset record with the new metadata.

CAUTION: Datasets are associated with specific versions (commits) of an ontology record. In order to update a dataset to the latest version of an ontology record, you'll need to remove the ontology, click btn:[Submit], then add that ontology back to the dataset.
